# Keras.js

Run trained [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras) models in your browser, GPU-powered using WebGL.

##### Why?

You have trained a cool and useful Keras model. Instead of setting up backend servers to process jobs and send the results to your users, you want your model to run as close to your user as possible.

##### Can I do training?

No. Why would you even want to?
